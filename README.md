# Vidmap
This was an app that I created that allows users to place markers on a public map containing a youtube video and a small amount of text.
The thumbnails of the videos are displayed on the map and the video of the closest marker is loaded at the top of the screen.
Recently the video player has stopped working unfortunately. I will have to come back to this soon
